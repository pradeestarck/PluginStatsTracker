PluginStatsTracker
------------------

Simple plugin statistics tracker & website display server.

"Plugin" in this context refers to Minecraft Spigot plugins ([Denizen](https://github.com/DenizenScript/Denizen) and [Sentinel](https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/Sentinel) in particular are my own use cases), but theoretically can be used for anything.

### State

Current project status: functional but incomplete. Some features not needed for my own case exist as placeholders only. You can view [my own instance of this server here](https://stats.mcmonkey.org/).

### How To Install/Run

Designed for and tested on a Debian Linux server.

Usage on other Linux distros is likely very similar. Usage outside Linux may require independent research regarding how to install DotNet 6, and how to run a generic executable service perpetually.

- Make sure you have `screen` and `dotnet-6-sdk` available
- Add a user for the service (via `adduser` generally, then `su` to that user)
- Clone the git repo (`git clone https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/PluginStatsTracker`) and enter the folder
- Make a folder labeled `config`, inside it make a text file labeled `config.fds`, and fill it with the config sample below (and change values to fit your configuration needs).
- Call `./update.sh`
- Will by default open on port 8131. To change this, edit `start.sh`
- It is strongly recommended you run this webserver behind a reverse proxy like Apache2 or Nginx.

For testing on Windows, `start.ps1` is also available to run via powershell.

### From Plugins

Must connect approximately once an hour to `(URL-BASE)/Stats/Submit` and send form-encoded content with `postid=pluginstats`, `plugin=(PLUGIN_NAME)`, `differentiator=(SOME_UNIQUE_VALUE)` (differentiate can be any semi-text, doesn't not need guaranteed uniqueness), and `pl_(FIELD_NAME)=(FIELD_VALUE)` for each field.

Connections that vary by up to 30 minutes from the hour mark will be persisted (duplication prevented via the differentiator value).

Fields can be numbers, text, or newline-separated lists

### Configuration

```yml
# Whether to test the "X-Forwarded-For" web header.
# Set to 'true' if running behind a reverse-proxy (like Apache2 or Nginx), 'false' if directly exposed.
trust-x-forwarded-for: true
# Set to the base URL for the webserver.
url-base: https://example.com
# List plugins to track stats for here
plugins:
    # Plugin ID as the key
    # Note: IDs should be 'a-z' and '_' only
    denizen:
        # The 'proper display name' of this plugin
        name: Denizen
        # Description, text
        description: Denizen is a scripting engine for Spigot servers!
        # Logo-image, URL to a .png or .gif

        # Set of tracked fields
        fields:
            # Field ID as the key
            # Note: ID should be 'a-z' and '_' only
            player_count:
                # Type: 'integer', 'text', or 'list'
                type: integer
                # Display text about it
                display: Online Players (Excluding Zeros)
                # For numbers, you can list value ranges.
                # Must be in format like '1' (exact number), or '11-15' (number range), 1001+ (overflow)
                # Numbers that don't match the options will be ignored (so in this example, '0' values get dropped)
                values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 50-75, 76-100, 101-150, 151-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500, 501-1000, 1001+
            server_version:
                type: text
                # 'text' and 'list' should define a maximum 'length' for strings
                length: 100
                display: Server Version
                # You can use 'any: true' for both text and number to just allow raw values through unfiltered
                any: true
```
